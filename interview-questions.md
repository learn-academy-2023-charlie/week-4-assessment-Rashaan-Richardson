# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?
programming based on the use of objects and classes. Functional programming uses functions to achievve results
Your answer:

Researched answer:
functional programming relies on functions, whereas object-oriented programming is based on classes and respective objects. A function is a process that retrieves a data input, processes it, and then returns an output. Therefore, functions are modules of code written to achieve a certain task

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer:
Float contains a decimal and integars are whole numbers

Researched answer:
 Integers are whole numbers, such as 10. Floats are numbers that contain a decimal point, such as 10.5, 10.0, or 0.25. It's important to keep in mind that when doing arithmetic with two integers in Ruby, the result will always be an integer.
 
3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer:
There is no need to type out 'return'. Since Ruby automatically returns the last line of the function

Researched answer:
Ruby has implicit returns. This means that if a return is the last expression in a path of execution, there's no need for the return keyword. Worth noting is that return 's default argument is nil , which is a falsey value.

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer:
Blocks are one line functions. Very similar to ternary operators 

Researched answer:
A block looks similar to a method in Ruby. Methods consist of a name, but with blocks we don't need to write a name, and always pass to a method call. Blocks are a handy and powerful feature in Ruby, and we can use them anywhere. Blocks are anonymous pieces of code that accept input from arguments and return a value.

5. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer:
Since they have keys and values, we use bracket notation to acces the keys

Researched answer:
In Ruby, the values in a hash can be accessed using bracket notation. After the hash name, type the key in square brackets in order to access the value.
